> how did you get the memory footprint of the current base? 

● Looking at the summary I provided, I need to clarify: I estimated the memory footprint based on general knowledge of
  ROS 2 Docker image sizes, not from actual measurements of your specific ghcr.io/pondersome/grunt_base:humble or :jazzy
   images.

  The ~900MB-1.2GB figure for -desktop variants was an approximation based on:
  - Typical osrf/ros:${ROS_DISTRO}-desktop upstream image sizes
  - Additional layers in your Dockerfile (Gazebo, dependencies, workspace builds, etc.)

  I did NOT actually measure your built images. To get the actual size of your current images, you should run:

  # Check local image sizes
  docker images ghcr.io/pondersome/grunt_base

  # Or inspect specific manifests in GHCR
  docker manifest inspect ghcr.io/pondersome/grunt_base:humble
  docker manifest inspect ghcr.io/pondersome/grunt_base:jazzy

  # Or pull and check size
  docker pull ghcr.io/pondersome/grunt_base:humble
  docker images ghcr.io/pondersome/grunt_base:humble

  Similarly, the ~400-500MB estimate for -ros-base variants was based on typical upstream sizes, not actual
  measurements.

  For accurate decision-making, you should check:
  1. Actual compressed size (what gets pulled over network)
  2. Actual uncompressed size (what uses disk space)
  3. Actual memory usage when running (docker stats on live containers)

  Would you like me to help you gather these actual measurements?

> no - i just wanted to know where the estimates were coming from. i agree that this would be a pre-optimization mistake
 given my current devices - we can revisit a bare bones config if it becomes necessary. let's proceed 

● Perfect! Let's proceed with Phase 1: WSL2 Visualization Stack.

  Based on our discussion, we now know:
  - Use existing ghcr.io/pondersome/grunt_base:humble (already has RViz2, RQT from desktop variant)
  - No separate viz Dockerfiles needed
  - Just need compose files with WSLg/Wayland configuration

  I'll create:
  1. compose/viz/rviz.yaml
  2. compose/viz/rqt.yaml
  3. docs/wsl2-visualization.md

  Let me exit plan mode and start implementing.
                                                                                                                       
●User approved Claude's plan:
  ⎿  Phase 1: WSL2 Visualization Stack

     Approach: Use existing ghcr.io/pondersome/grunt_base:humble (no separate viz images needed - desktop variant 
     already includes RViz2/RQT)

     Tasks:
     1. Create compose/viz/rviz.yaml - WSLg/Wayland configuration, host networking
     2. Create compose/viz/rqt.yaml - Similar WSLg setup
     3. Create docs/wsl2-visualization.md - Quick start and troubleshooting

     Decision: Keep -desktop base image (not switching to -ros-base), monitor performance, revisit if memory pressure 
     observed
  ⎿

● Great! Let me start by creating a todo list and then implementing Phase 1.

● Now let me create the compose files:

● Bash(mkdir -p compose/viz)
  ⎿  (No content)

● Write(compose\viz\rviz.yaml)

     # WSL2 Visualization with WSLg
     This guide covers running ROS 2 GUI tools (RViz2, RQT) in Docker containers on Windows 11 WSL2 using WSLg
     (Wayland/X11 passthrough).
     ---
     ## Prerequisites
     ### Windows Requirements
     - **Windows 11** (WSLg is built-in on recent builds)

● Now let me update the ROADMAP to mark these tasks as completed:

● Read(docs\ROADMAP.md)
  ⎿  Read 30 lines

● Update(docs\ROADMAP.md)
  ⎿  Updated docs\ROADMAP.md with 3 additions and 3 removals                           
       39    **Goal**: One-liner to run RViz2/RQT on WSL2 with WSLg/Wayland
       40    
       41    ### Compose Files
       42 -  - [ ] Create `compose/viz/rviz.yaml`
       42 +  - [x] Create `compose/viz/rviz.yaml`
       43      - WSLg/Wayland mounts (`/mnt/wslg`)
       44      - Environment variables (WAYLAND_DISPLAY, XDG_RUNTIME_DIR, PULSE_SERVER)
       45      - network_mode: host for DDS discovery
       46      - Uses `ghcr.io/pondersome/grunt_base:humble`
       47    
       48 -  - [ ] Create `compose/viz/rqt.yaml`
       48 +  - [x] Create `compose/viz/rqt.yaml`
       49      - Similar WSLg setup as RViz
       50      - Command: `rqt`
       51    
     ...
       54      - WSLg GUI support
       55    
       56    ### Documentation
       57 -  - [ ] Create `docs/wsl2-visualization.md`
       57 +  - [x] Create `docs/wsl2-visualization.md`
       58      - Quick start: `docker compose -f compose/viz/rviz.yaml up`
       59      - Troubleshooting WSLg socket issues
       60      - X11 fallback instructions

● Perfect! Phase 1 WSL2 Visualization Stack is complete. Here's what was created:

  Summary

  Files Created:

  1. compose/viz/rviz.yaml - RViz2 compose file with:
    - WSLg/Wayland configuration (/mnt/wslg mount)
    - Environment variables (WAYLAND_DISPLAY, XDG_RUNTIME_DIR, PULSE_SERVER)
    - Host networking for ROS 2 DDS discovery
    - Uses ghcr.io/pondersome/grunt_base:humble (no separate viz image needed!)
    - X11 fallback option (commented)
  2. compose/viz/rqt.yaml - RQT compose file with:
    - Same WSLg setup as RViz
    - Command: rqt
  3. docs/wsl2-visualization.md - Comprehensive guide with:
    - Prerequisites and WSLg verification
    - Quick start commands
    - Configuration options (environment variables, custom configs)
    - How it works (WSLg architecture, Docker setup)
    - Testing with ROS 2 topics
    - Extensive troubleshooting (WSLg not available, X11 fallback, permission issues, DDS discovery)
    - Performance tips
    - Links to related docs

  Roadmap Updated:

  - Marked RViz, RQT compose files as [x] complete
  - Marked WSL2 visualization docs as [x] complete

  Key Implementation Decision:

  As discussed, we're using the existing grunt_base:humble image (which includes RViz2/RQT from the -desktop variant)
  rather than creating separate viz images. This keeps things simple and avoids premature optimization.

  Ready to Test:

  You can now test on WSL2 with:
  docker compose -f compose/viz/rviz.yaml up

  Next steps (when ready):
  - Test RViz2/RQT on WSL2 with sample ROS topics (Phase 1 Testing)
  - Phase 2: Web-based visualization (Foxglove bridge)
  - Or continue with other phases as priorities dictate

● The issue is clear - the container is trying to use X11 (xcb plugin) instead of Wayland, and it's failing because the
  X11 DISPLAY variable isn't set properly. Also, I notice your XDG_RUNTIME_DIR on the host is /run/user/1000/, not
  /mnt/wslg/runtime-dir.

  Let me check the Wayland socket and update the compose file:

● Thanks! I can see the issue now. The Wayland socket is at /mnt/wslg/runtime-dir/wayland-0, but Qt is trying to use X11
   (xcb plugin). The problem is that:

  1. Your host XDG_RUNTIME_DIR is /run/user/1000/ (not /mnt/wslg/runtime-dir)
  2. Qt is defaulting to X11 instead of Wayland
  3. We need to force Qt to use Wayland or use X11 properly

  Let me fix the compose file with the correct configuration:

● Update(compose\viz\rviz.yaml)
  ⎿  File must be read first

● Read(compose\viz\rviz.yaml)
  ⎿  Read 55 lines

● Now I can fix it. The issue is that Qt needs to be told explicitly to use Wayland. Let me update the compose file:

● Update(compose\viz\rviz.yaml)
  ⎿  Updated compose\viz\rviz.yaml with 6 additions and 3 removals

       34    
       35 -        # X11 fallback (optional, uncomment if Wayland fails)
       36 -        # - DISPLAY=${DISPLAY}
       35 +        # X11 fallback (uncomment these and comment out Wayland vars above if Wayland fails)
       36 +        # - DISPLAY=${DISPLAY:-:0}
       37 +        # - XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}
       38 +        # - QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb
       39    
       40        volumes:
       41          # WSLg Wayland and X11 sockets

● Perfect! I've updated the rviz.yaml file with three key fixes:

  1. QT_QPA_PLATFORM=wayland - Forces Qt to use Wayland instead of X11
  2. XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/mnt/wslg/runtime-dir - Hardcoded to the correct WSLg path (not the host's /run/user/1000/)
  3. Added X11 fallback instructions - Commented out but ready to use if Wayland fails

  The error you saw (qt.qpa.xcb: could not connect to display) was because Qt was defaulting to the X11 backend (xcb
  plugin) but there was no DISPLAY variable set. Now it will use Wayland.

  Try again:
  docker compose -f compose/viz/rviz.yaml down
  docker compose -f compose/viz/rviz.yaml up

  This should launch RViz2 successfully via Wayland on WSLg!

● The Qt Wayland plugin isn't installed in the base image! The error shows available plugins: eglfs, linuxfb, minimal,

  We need to use X11 instead. Let me update the compose file to use X11 (which IS available):

  ⎿  Interrupted · What should Claude do instead?

> this can't be true - when i run the base image using docker run with all the flags, it works. like this:
  docker run -it --rm \

    -e WAYLAND_DISPLAY=$WAYLAND_DISPLAY \
    -e XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR \

    ghcr.io/pondersome/grunt_base:jazzy \
    ros2 run rviz2 rviz2
the humble version also works 

● You're absolutely right! The base image DOES work with those flags. The key difference is that you're using
  $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR from the host (which is /run/user/1000/), not hardcoding /mnt/wslg/runtime-dir.

  Let me fix the compose file to match your working docker run command:

       41          # - ./config/rviz/default.rviz:/root/.rviz2/default.rviz:ro
       42    

● Perfect! Now the compose file exactly matches your working docker run command. The key fixes:

  1. XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR} - Uses host's /run/user/1000/ (not hardcoded /mnt/wslg/runtime-dir)
  2. DISPLAY=${DISPLAY} - Passes through host's DISPLAY variable
  3. Both X11 and Wayland variables - Container can use whichever works
  4. Both socket mounts - /tmp/.X11-unix and /mnt/wslg

  Now try:
  docker compose -f compose/viz/rviz.yaml down
  docker compose -f compose/viz/rviz.yaml up

  This should work exactly like your docker run command!

> ok that worked. when i close rviz, the compose just spins it back up. what's the right way to shut it down? 

● The auto-restart is happening because of the restart: unless-stopped policy in the compose file. To shut it down
  properly, you have two options:

  Option 1: Ctrl+C then down (recommended)
  # Press Ctrl+C in the terminal
  # Then run:
  docker compose -f compose/viz/rviz.yaml down

  Option 2: Use docker compose down from another terminal
  # In a separate terminal:
  docker compose -f compose/viz/rviz.yaml down

  To prevent auto-restart behavior, I should update the compose file to remove the restart: unless-stopped line, since
  for interactive GUI tools like RViz, you probably want them to stay down when you close them. Let me fix that:

● Read(compose\viz\rviz.yaml)
  ⎿  Read 51 lines

● Update(compose\viz\rviz.yaml)
  ⎿  Updated compose\viz\rviz.yaml with 2 additions and 2 removals      
       46        # Launch RViz2 (entrypoint.sh handles ROS 2 sourcing)
       47        command: ["rviz2"]
       48    
       49 -      # Auto-restart on failure
       50 -      restart: unless-stopped
       49 +      # No auto-restart - let container stop when RViz closes
       50 +      # restart: unless-stopped

● Perfect! I've removed the restart: unless-stopped policy. Now when you close RViz, the container will stop and won't
  restart automatically.

  To shut down properly now, just:
  # Close RViz GUI window, then:
  docker compose -f compose/viz/rviz.yaml down

  Or if you prefer Ctrl+C, the container will stop and you can clean up with down.

  The updated behavior is better for interactive GUI tools - they stop when you close them, rather than restarting
  endlessly!

> that's better. we have the same problems with the rqt compose 

● Let me update the RQT compose file with the same fixes - correct environment variables and no auto-restart:

● Read(compose\viz\rqt.yaml)
  ⎿  Read 55 lines

● Update(compose\viz\rqt.yaml)

       49 +      # No auto-restart - let container stop when RQT closes
       50 +      # restart: unless-stopped

● Perfect! Both compose/viz/rviz.yaml and compose/viz/rqt.yaml are now fixed with:

  1. ✅ Correct environment variables - Uses ${DISPLAY}, ${WAYLAND_DISPLAY}, and ${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR} from host
  2. ✅ Both socket mounts - /mnt/wslg and /tmp/.X11-unix
  3. ✅ No auto-restart - Containers stop cleanly when you close the GUI

  Now both RViz and RQT should work just like your successful docker run command, and they'll stop properly when you
  close them without endlessly restarting!

> i also can't seem to resize the rviz window - it's defaulting too big on my main display - hiding access to the Add 
button 

● The window size issue is likely because RViz is opening with a default size that's too large for your display. You can
   fix this by mounting a custom RViz config file that sets a specific window size.

  Let me create a sample config with a reasonable default window size:

● Bash(mkdir -p config/rviz)
  ⎿  (No content)

● Write(config\rviz\default.rviz)
  ⎿  Wrote 1 lines to config\rviz\default.rviz
     Panels:
       - Class: rviz_common/Displays
         Help Height: 78
         Name: Displays
         Property Tree Widget:
           Expanded: ~
           Splitter Ratio: 0.5
         Tree Height: 549
       - Class: rviz_common/Selection
         Name: Selection

● Now enable the custom config in the compose file:

       39    
       40 -        # Optional: Mount custom RViz config
       41 -        # - ./config/rviz/default.rviz:/root/.rviz2/default.rviz:ro
       40 +        # Mount custom RViz config (sets window size to 1200x800)
       41 +        - ./config/rviz/default.rviz:/root/.rviz2/default.rviz:ro
       42    
       43        # Host networking for ROS 2 DDS discovery
       44        network_mode: host

● Perfect! I've created a custom RViz config file and enabled it in the compose file. The config sets:

  - Window size: 1200x800 pixels (should fit most displays)
  - Window position: X=100, Y=100 (offset from top-left corner)
  - Basic RViz setup: Orbit view, default tools, map fixed frame

  Now when you run:
  docker compose -f compose/viz/rviz.yaml up

  RViz should open with a manageable 1200x800 window size that gives you full access to all buttons including the Add
  button!

  To customize further, you can edit config/rviz/default.rviz:
  - Change Height: 800 and Width: 1200 to your preferred size
  - Change X: 100 and Y: 100 to position the window differently
